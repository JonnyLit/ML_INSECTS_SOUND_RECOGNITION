In this folder are contained the python files to train a neural network model (running "main.py") for an augmented AI-Belha dataset.

The original dataset was only 163MB big, available at the link:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/NOSInovacao/AI-Belha

Since from these 163MB of files we can obtain only around 5000 .wav audio samples with the following properties:

16KHz Sample Rate
16 bit depth
1 second long
PCM format
little/signed
1 channel

then these audio files have been augmented to almost 100'000 samples 
(using some data agumentation techniques, see file "data_augmentation_2.py").

The dataset has been labeled for a 5 class classifier, that comprises the following classes:

-queen_absent
-queen_present_newly_accepted
-queen_present_original
-queen_present_rejected
-unknown

To obtain good results, it has been built a model that combines some neural blocks that 
belong to the well known RESNET-50 (the "residual blocks")
with some attention blocks "CBAM-Blocks" of the RESNET50-CBAM NN (see the "cbam.pdf" paper in this folder).
This combination leads more or less to the following good results:

-validation_loss: around 0.25
-validation_accuracy: around 98%
-validation_precision: around 98%
-validation_recall: around 98%

The number of parameters of the model is around 700'000, but can be lowered to around 180'000 at 
the cost of more or less 0.5-1% (loss, accuracy, precision and recall between 97% and 97.5%).

For more details see the files in this folder
 "log.txt" and the scans "Confusion_Matrix.png" and "Loss_Accuracy_Precision_Recall.png".
