The Kicad9 project is named "MY-ESP32".

The project consists in an ESP32 board for LiFePO4 3.6V batteries or USB use,
where the quiescent currents are low in order to use the ESP32 in deep-sleep mode
without wasting too much energy. 

For example, the normal ESP32-board ('board' and not 'module') uses 
the linear regulator 'AMS1117' to convert the 5V coming from the USB 
to 3.3V used by the ESP32 module in order to work properly.
This linear regulator has a quiescent current of about 5mA (too high),
so not convenient for battery use.
The new project instead uses an efficient buck-boost (up to 96% eff) 
in order to get the 3.3V needed, with a quiescent current in the order of 40uA.
It has been also added the possibility to charge the batteries through 
the same USB port used for programming the module.
There are also some protection diodes that add up to the overall quiescent current,
when working in reverse bias (about 20-30uA total).

So, it could be supposed that a lot of current will be 
saved when working in deep sleep mode (70uA VS 5mA --> 5000/70 = 70 times less current used).
